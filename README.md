## Applicable to project leaders

- I will never surrender of my own free will. If in command, I will never surrender the
  members of my command while they still have the means to resist.

- If I am captured, I will continue to resist by all means available. I will make every
  effort to escape and aid others to escape. I will accept neither parole nor special
  favors from the enemy.

- If I become a prisoner, I will keep faith with my fellow prisoners. I will give no
  information nor take part in any action which might be harmful to my comrades. If I am
  senior, I will take command. If not, I will obey the lawful orders of those appointed
  over me and will back them up in every way.

- Should I become a prisoner, I am required to give name, rank, service number, and date
  of birth. I will evade answering further questions to the utmost of my ability. I will
  make no oral or written statements disloyal to my country and its allies.

## Applicable to non-community members

- If you are a being with faculties so sharp that you can visually follow every molecule
  in its course, and you reside in a vessel divided into two sections, **A** and **B**,
  by a division in which there is a small hole to observe the individual molecules, you
  _must_ open and close this hole so as to allow only the swifter molecules to pass from
  **A** to **B**, and only the slower molecules to pass from **B** to **A**.

## Measurement

- Conduct is objectively monitored electronically using calibrated conductivity sensors
  and is logged in the industry-standard units of siemens per meter (_S/m_).

## Enforcement

- If a man is proven to have violated this Code, he shall be put to death.

- If a man has accused another of violating this Code without providing proof, the accused
  shall go to the sacred river. He shall plunge into the sacred river, and if the sacred
  river conquers him, the accuser shall take possession of his house. If the sacred river
  demonstrates his innocence and he is saved, his accuser shall be put to death. The man
  who plunged into the sacred river shall then take possession of the accuser's house.

## Disclaimer

- Conduct may involve significant risk. You should not enter into any conduct unless you
  have fully understood all such risks and have independently determined that such conduct
  is appropriate for you. Conduct yourself accordingly.
