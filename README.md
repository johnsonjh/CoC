## Applicable to project leaders

* I will never surrender of my own free will. If in command, I will never surrender the
  members of my command while they still have the means to resist.

* If I am captured, I will continue to resist by all means available. I will make every
  effort to escape and aid others to escape. I will accept neither parole nor special
  favors from the enemy.

* If I become a prisoner, I will keep faith with my fellow prisoners. I will give no
  information nor take part in any action which might be harmful to my comrades.  If I am
  senior, I will take command. If not, I will obey the lawful orders of those appointed over
  me and will back them up in every way.

* Should I become a prisoner, I am required to give name, rank, service number, and date of
  birth. I will evade answering further questions to the utmost of my ability. I will make
  no oral or written statements disloyal to my country and its allies.

## Measurement

* Conduct is objectively electronically monitored via calibrated conductivity sensors and
  logged in industry standard units of siemens per meter (*S/m*).

## Enforcement

* If a man is proven to have violated this Code, he shall be put to death.

* If a man has accused another of violating this Code, but has not proven it, the accused shall go to
  the sacred river, he shall plunge into the sacred river, and if the sacred river shall conquer him,
  he that accused him shall take possession of his house. If the sacred river shall show his innocence
  and he is saved, his accuser shall be put to death, and he that plunged into the sacred river shall
  appropriate the house of him that accused him.

## Disclaimer

* Conduct may involve significant risk. You should not enter into any conduct unless you have fully
  understood all such risks and have independently determined that such conduct is appropriate for you.
